# Push_Swap

The Push Swap project involves creating a C program called push_swap that sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort the numbers in the stack in ascending order, using only two additional stacks and a specific set of operations.






## Rules

-There are two stacks, named A and B.

-At the beginning, stack A contains a random amount of positive and/or negative numbers, without duplicates.

-Stack B is empty.

-The objective is to sort the numbers in stack A in ascending order, so that the smallest number is at the top of stack A.

-A set of allowed operations are provided to manipulate the stacks, such as swap, push, rotate, and reverse rotate.

## How to run the program

Run the program with stack A as an argument, passing a list of integers separated by spaces.

The program will display the shortest list of instructions to sort stack A.
